PyIDLPhot
=========

Some of the IDL Astrolib photometry algorithms translated to Python.

To install, just append the PyIDLPhot directory to your PYTHONPATH
environment variable.  Then import routines by, for example:

from PyIDLPhot import pkfit

Additional documentation is provided in the individual routines.
